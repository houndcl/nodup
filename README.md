# Bao et al. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice (Figure 1a)
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2312-y

## To run
Required R package
imager, imagerExtra, ggplot2, ggthemes, dplyr, viridis
```
Rscript check.R
```

## Finding
- A symmetric focal spike detected
- Extremely high correlation (R2 > 0.9 for at least 2 channels)
- Similar edge trace

## Conclusion
- ACE2-Mock and WT-HB-01 immunohistochemical images are from the **same** sample
- Since no perfect overlap (even with background extraction) can be detected, these are two images taken at different time or with different microscope settings
